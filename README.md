# PWA Text Editor

## Description

task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.



### User Story

AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use.
```

### Tools and Technologies Used

- IndexedDB (via the idb package) as a database
- Webpack to bundle front-end code
- Workbox to create a service worker that caches static assets
- Heroku.
